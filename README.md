Description:  We develop a flexible procedure (STAMP) based on mixture models to perform region based meta-analysis of different phenotypes using data from different GWAS and identify subsets of associated phenotypes. To run variance-component (quadratic test) under mixture model use mixtureQuad.r and mixtureLinear.r to run for burden (linear) tests.
